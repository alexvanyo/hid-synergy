Remember to delete the "# README & DELETE #" sections.

First, we'll need to know your OS versions, here's how you find that out:

- Windows: Press `Windows+R` and type `winver`, then press return
- Mac: Open the Apple menu (top left of the screen) and click `About this Mac`
- Linux: Copy and paste the output of this command: `$ cat /etc/issue`

It's very important that you distinguish which is the client and which is the server.
The server is the computer that the mouse and keyboard are shared from.

e.g.:

Server: exampleOS 10.13
Client: Foobar XP

### Synergy Version ###

# README & DELETE #

---BEGIN HELP---

Ok, next is the Synergy version. Please don't rely on Linux package manager versioning,
they sometimes get it wrong. Use the `--version` arg to get your installed Synergy version.

- Synergy 1: `synergys --version`
- Synergy 2: `synergy-core --server --version`

If you're not using the latest version, please update: https://symless.com/synergy/downloads

### Steps to Reproduce ###

---BEGIN HELP---

This is the really important bit. Try to remember exactly what you were doing at the time,
make sure the steps are numbered, like so:

1. Do a little dance
2. Make a little love
3. Get down tonight

If you think it'll help, end by saying what actually happened and what you expected to
happen. Before submitting, try to reproduce the bug based on the steps you provided.

### Run Method ###

# README & DELETE #

---BEGIN HELP---

How are you running Synergy? If you're running it straight from the command line,
please include the command line arguments.

Otherwise, if you're clicking on the Synergy icon, just say "Config app".

---END HELP---

### Log URLs ###

# README & DELETE #

---BEGIN HELP---

Please do not paste entire logs here, it looks really silly. Instead, upload your logs,
and share the URLs to the uploaded logs. Here's how you that:

Synergy 1: https://symless.com/help/s1-troubleshooting/s1-sending-logs
Synergy 2: https://symless.com/help/s2-troubleshooting/s2-sending-logs

Make sure you say which log is for which computer, and also which computer is the
client and which one is the server. This helps to avoid any confusion.
